Group 2 Project Proposal

Team members: Grace Roseman, Ankita Budhraja, Drake White, Lingxiao Pan

One paragraph to summarize your idea:
We are going to use a movie API to randomly generate a movie. Users will be shown hints about the movie and users will have to guess what movie it is. We are considering having users select a genre to pull from, a difficulty level, and/or selecting movies from a specific year range. 

What External API you plan to use and why:
TMDB API: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started because it seems to be a database of movies and we saw that this website: https://www.generatormix.com/random-movie-generator uses that api
Or Open AI API: https://openai.com/product to generate a random movie and details about it
